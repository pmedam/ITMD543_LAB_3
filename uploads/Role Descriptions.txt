CDK Role Description:
My main duty as an RPA Solution Developer is to develop and execute robotic process automation solutions that improve accuracy and efficiency in operations. I carefully crafted automation scripts that mimic manual operations within business processes, developing both process-level and object-level logic. Apart from the aforementioned, my responsibility includes the entire RPA development lifecycle, from the initial design to the post-deployment maintenance.

As the company's first RPA Developer, I also created deployment packages to make sure the automation was prepared for a smooth transition into the production (PROD) environment. Paying close attention to detail also applies to testing, where I will find and fix any flaws to guarantee the automation runs without a hitch.

Furthermore, I prioritised prompt issue resolution and system stability in my comprehensive support plan, which I developed to handle any problems that could come up after deployment. Additionally, I kept up with documentation that appropriately reflects the most recent process flows. Most importantly, during the migration, you'll take into account and incorporate business enhancement demands into the RPA solution to make sure it stays in line with changing business needs.

As CDK Global's first RPA Developer, I play a critical role in advancing the organization's adoption of RPA, enhancing business procedures, and proactively addressing the ever-changing demands of the business environment.
